## Simple Hosted Playground

Sometimes when learning JavaScript, you want to open the Chrome or Firefox developer tools and play around. Often times, you open on a random website where there could be JS errors or other _environment_ things that are annoying. This is a simple tool to help replace that.

Also, I built in support for a few common libraries. To use any of the supported libraries, just add it to the query string.

Like so - `?j` would load jQuery, where `?j&u` would load jQuery and Underscore, and so on.
